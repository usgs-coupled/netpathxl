NetpathXL @VER@                                @RELEASE_DATE@

To install NetpathXL, double-click NetpathXL-@VER@-@REL@.msi as
a user with administrator privileges.

Two programs are distributed, DBXL and NetpathXL. They are normally
installed in the directory c:\program files\usgs\NetpathXL\bin. They
can be run from the start menu or by browsing for the executables. A
shortcut can be added to the desktop by right-clicking on the
executable and selecting Send To->Desktop.

The program DbXL.exe has four functions: (1) to convert a .lon file
(created by Netpath or PHREEQC) to an Excel file, (2) to open an
existing NetpathXL file (.xls), (3) to create a new NetpathXL file
(.xls), and (4) to create a PHREEQC input file (.pqi) from an existing
NetpathXL file (.xls). All the basic chemical data for Netpath
calculations are stored in the Excel file.  Once you have you have
NetpathXL spreadsheet files, simply copy and modify the Excel files as
needed to generate new spreadsheet files.  The columns of the
NetpathXL spreadsheet are fixed and can not be changed.

NetpathXL.exe will read an old .pat file (created by DB), a new .pat
file (created by NetpathXL), a new .pat file created by PHREEQC, or a
NetpathXL spreadsheet file (.xls). Once a file has been read, all the
usual NETPATH calculations can be performed. The file db.dat is used
to speciate the data in the Excel file at the beginning of running
NetpathXL.exe. This database file is stored in the installation
directory. The file Netpath.dat contains mineral stoichiometries used
by NetpathXL.exe.  NetpathXL looks for this file in the working
directory (the directory containing the .xls or .pat file). If it is
not found, the distributed version of this file, which is
stored in the installation directory, is copied to the working
directory. The calculation engine and all model development in
NetpathXL is identical to Netpath.

Documentation for Netpath is available in the doc subdirectory of the
installation directory or at 
http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/netpath.

Report bugs to dlpark@usgs.gov.

--------
svn 4805
--------
  Fixed bug in NetpathXL that caused Excel to not be closed after
  a bad Excel file was opened.
  
  Updated Intel Fortran Compiler to 11.1.054 in order to run
  correctly on Windows 7.

--------
svn 4486
--------
  Fixed bug in DBXL that limited number of wells to 50. Caused
  program to exit if 51 wells were a .lon file. Current limit is
  400 wells.
  
  Modified NetpathXL to skip model files that have no initial solution, 
  only a final solution. PHREEQC will generate these model files when
  all of the water in the final solution is generated by mineral
  reactions, sometimes, but not always, when H2O(g) is a reactant.
  
  Also fixed a feature in PHREEQC that included solution -7 in the
  selected-output file during inverse-modeling calculations. These 
  lines are now excluded from the selected-output file. 

--------
svn 4337
--------
  Fixed error with long Excel path names that wrapped on the edit
  screen. Caused the final option to be overwritten and not 
  visible.
